# CPU-Bars
CPU Bars skin for rainmeter!

Check the variables under [variables] section of the ini file for customisation of bar width, length, etc

By default it's set up for 16 thread CPUs! If you have more/less, feel free to duplicate/delete the CPUMeasure and M blocks to your required thread count
(so if you have an 8 thread cpu, you could delete all of the CPUMeasure and M blocks except for the 1-8 blocks and if you have a 24 thread cpu, you would create an extra block for each thread, numbering them correctly)
